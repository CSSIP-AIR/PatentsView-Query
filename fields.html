            <h1>PatentsView Query Builder</h1>
            <p>
              The PatentsView Query Builder provides an easy to use web
              interface for querying data on patents, inventors, and assignees
              from the PatentsView database. From the main page, users can
              select to perform a Quick Search or an Advanced Search.
            </p>

            <h2><a class="anchor" name="quick"></a>Quick Search</h2>

            <p>
              The Quick Search generates an automatic query of the PatentsView
              database for all of the entered search terms against the patent
              title or patent abstract. For example, entering "photovoltaic
              solar cell" in the Quick Search box will yield results for which
              all three search terms, "photovoltaic", "solar", and "cell",
              appear in the patent title or patent abstract.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon submitting a Quick Search, users are redirected to
              <a href="#step3">Step 3: Select Output Fields.</a>
            </p>

            <h2><a class="anchor" name="advanced"></a>Advanced Search</h2>

            <p>
              The Advanced Search allows users to build a detailed query against
              the PatentsView database in 3 Steps.
            </p>

            <h4><a class="anchor" name="step1"></a>Step 1: Select Category</h4>

            <p>
              In Step 1, select the primary category of interest: patents,
              inventors, or assignees. Query results will be organized based on
              these primary categories, which correspond to the
              <a href="/api/" target="_blank">PatentsView API Endpoints.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, suppose you are interested in querying the
              PatentsView database for a particular inventor named "Austin L.
              Gurney". If you want to retrieve detailed information regarding
              all of Austin L. Gurney’s patents (e.g. patent title and abstract,
              filing and grant dates, technology classification, and citations),
              you would select "patents" as the primary category. If, rather,
              you are interested in the individuals that Austin L. Gurney
              collaborated with on these inventions, you would select
              "inventors" as the primary category. This would allow you to
              retrieve information on Austin L. Gurney’s co-inventors (e.g.
              first and last name, location). Alternatively, if you are
              interested in where Austin L. Gurney worked when he produced his
              patented technology, you would select "assignee" as the primary
              category to obtain detailed information on those organizations
              (e.g. name, location, total number of patents and inventors).
            </p>

            <h4>
              <a class="anchor" name="step2"></a>Step 2: Select Search Criteria
            </h4>

            <p>
              Build a detailed query against the data fields in the PatentsView
              database in Step 2. Available searchable fields update based on
              the primary category selected in Step 1. Search fields are grouped
              by patents, inventors, assignees, and each technology
              classification. The patents category also contains citation search
              fields. See the Query Builder Data Dictionary for detailed
              information on search fields, including definitions and formats.
            </p>

            <p>
              To create a search criterion, select a search field from one of
              the dropdown menus. This will populate the middle dropdown menu
              with available comparison operators (e.g. equals, not equal,
              greater, etc.). Enter search term, date, number, or code in the
              input box and select the "Add to Search". When a search criterion
              is added, it will appear in the Search Summary box. Additional
              search criterion can be added to the query in a similar manner.
            </p>

            <p>
              Search criteria can be removed by clicking the cross sign next to
              an individual criteria or the "Clear all" button.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once all search criteria are added to the Search Summary, select
              the Submit Search button to enter the query.
            </p>

            <h4>
              <a class="anchor" name="step3"></a>Step 3: Select Output Fields
            </h4>

            <p>
              Select fields to be included in the output data in Step 3.
              Available output fields are grouped by patents, inventors,
              assignees, technology classifications, and citations (for Patents
              category). Note that selecting multiple many-to-one output fields
              (e.g. inventor first and last name and assignee organization name
              for a patent query) can result in duplicate rows in the output
              data if CSV format is selected.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once all output fields are chosen, click the Preview Query to view
              a sample of the output data.
            </p>

            <h4>
              <a class="anchor" name="preview"></a>Preview and Customize Results
            </h4>

            <p>
              Review search criteria and preview query results in CSV or JSON
              format. Additional changes can be made to search criteria and
              output fields, by clicking the Edit button.
            </p>

            <p>
              Customize output data by sorting query results and selecting the
              desired file format(s). Enter email address where links to output
              data will be delivered and select Submit Query.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upon successfully submitting a query, results will be emailed to
              the designated email address. The email will also include the API
              query used to generate results. If results are not received within
              24 hours, please contact
              <a href="mailto:cssip@air.org">cssip@air.org</a>.

            <h1>Query Builder FAQs</h1>
            <h2>
              <a class="anchor" name="definitions"></a>Where are the data field
              definitions that can be queried and retrieved using the
              PatentsView Query Builder?
            </h2>

            <p>
              Key terms in the patent data are defined in the
              <a href="/api/glossary.html" target="_blank">Glossary</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The primary category defines the search groups available to define
              specific criteria. The
              <a href="/query/data_dictionary.html" target="_blank"
                >Query Tool Data Dictionary</a
              >
              provides definitions, search group, and category of all searchable
              and output fields.
            </p>

            <h2>
              <a class="anchor" name="boolean"></a>Can I use Boolean operators
              in Quick Search?
            </h2>

            <p>
              Boolean operators are not allowed throughout the Query Builder,
              including in Quick Search. For example, if a phrase "bicycle OR
              tire" is queried, the Query Builder will search for all these
              words – "bicycle", "or", "tire" – in the patent title or patent
              abstract. The PatentsView API provides additional functionality
              and can be used for more complex queries.
            </p>

            <h2>
              <a class="anchor" name="advanced_boolean"></a>Can I apply an OR
              condition to my Advanced Search criteria?
            </h2>
            <p>
              In Step 2, all search criteria defaults to an AND condition. For
              example, search criteria "Assignee Organization contains
              Microsoft", "Patent Year greater 2006", and "CPC Subsection ID
              equals H04" will yield results in which all three conditions are
              met. User cannot change this to an OR condition. Instead, user
              should submit a separate query to identify alternative results.
              For example, to identify patents granted after 2006 in CPC
              Subsection H04 (Electric communication technique) to Microsoft or
              Intel Corporation, a separate query can be submitted with the
              following search criteria: "Assignee Organization contains Intel
              Corporation", "Patent Year greater 2006", and "CPC Subsection ID
              equals H04".
            </p>

            <h2>
              <a class="anchor" name="assignee"></a>How do I search for patents
              granted to a specific company?
            </h2>
            <p>
              To search for the patents granted to a specific company or
              organization using Advanced Search, select Patents as the primary
              category in Step 1. In Step 2, select the "Assignee Organization"
              search field from the dropdown menu under Assignees. Select the
              appropriate operator from the middle dropdown menu. Then, input
              the firm name in the text box. The "Assignee Organization" search
              field has typeahead functionality, so that a menu of observed
              organization names matching the entered text will appear below the
              text box. Choose the appropriate name and select the Add to Search
              button to add the search criterion to your query. It will appear
              in the Search Summary box. Select the Submit Search button to
              enter the query and move on to select desired output fields.
            </p>

              <a class="anchor" name="location"></a>How do I find all the
              inventors in one city?
            </h2>
            <p>
              To search for the names of all inventors in one city using
              Advanced Search, select Inventors as the primary category in Step
              1. In Step 2, select one of two search fields that capture an
              inventor’s city: "Inventor City At Issue" or "Inventor City Last
              Known Location".
            </p>

            <p>
              The "Inventor City At Issue" search field can be used to identify
              all inventors located in the designated city at the time a patent
              for which they are listed as an inventor was granted. Since
              inventors can have multiple patents and relocate between each
              patent grant, an individual inventor can have multiple values for
              the "Inventor City At Issue" field. Searching on the "Inventor
              City At Issue" will yield all inventors that were ever located in
              the designated city when at least one of their patents was
              granted.
            </p>

            <p>
              The "Inventor City Last Known Location" is the city associated
              with the designated inventors most recent patent grant date (i.e.,
              the "Inventor Last Seen Date"). Thus, it captures the most
              recently known address for the designated inventor. Each unique
              inventor (as indicated by Inventor ID) in the PatentsView database
              has only one "Last Known Location".
            </p>

            <p>
              Comparable "At Issue" and "Last Known" location search fields can
              be used to identify all the patent holding organizations or
              "assignees" in one city. Note that the same city name can exist in
              different states or countries, so users should take care to
              specify city, state (U.S. only) and country fields in the search
              criteria.

              <a class="anchor" name="govint"></a>How do I find patents for
              which a Federal Government agency has some interest?
            </h2>
            <p>
              To search for patents for which a Federal Government agency has
              some interest using Advanced Search, select Patents as the primary
              category in Step 1. In Step 2, select the "Government Organization
              Name" search field from the dropdown menu under Patents. Select
              the appropriate operator from the middle dropdown menu. Then,
              input the name of the Federal Government entity in the text box.
            </p>

            <p>
              The "Government Organization Name" search field captures the name
              of the U.S. government organization as reported in the government
              interest statement and can include high-level Federal agencies or
              subordinate institutions. For example, the National Institutes of
              Health (NIH) report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
              Services (DHHS), while individual NIH institutes (e.g. National
              Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Cancer Institute, etc.)
              report to the NIH. To search each level of the hierarchy, select
              the search field for the appropriate level (e.g., Top Level
              Government Organization, Second Level Government Organization, or
              Third Level Government Organization). For example, to find patents
              for which DHHS and all its subordinate institutions (i.e., NIH,
              Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Centers for Disease
              Control and Prevention, etc.), select the Top Level Government
              Organization search field and input "Department for Health and
              Human Services" in the text box. Similarly, if you are looking
              only for the patents for which NIH and its subordinate institutes
              have interest, select the Second Level Government Organization
              Search Field and input "National Institutes of Health" in the text
              box.

            <h2>
              <a class="anchor" name="fullpreview"></a>Is there a way to preview
              results before submitting the full search?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Users can preview the results of their query before submitting the
              full search. The preview dataset contains up to top 10 rows of the
              full dataset and is presented in CSV or JSON format.
            </p>

            <h2>
              <a class="anchor" name="noresults"></a>The query returns no
              results but is seemingly valid. Why?
            </h2>
            <p>
              A query may not return results if the search terms used do not
              conform to the data field formats in the PatentsView database as
              parsed directly from the raw files published by the USPTO. See the
              Query Builder Data Dictionary for examples of valid query formats
              for each search field.
            </p>

            <p>
              A query may also fail if the size of the output data file exceeds
              1GB. If you expect your query will result in an output file of
              greater than 1GB in size, consider conducting multiple queries
              with the same search criterion but different output fields.
              Alternatively, you can generate several output datasets based on
              different date ranges and other query criteria.
