<p>Use the data display options above to view results by Patent, Inventor, Assignee, or Class. When Class is selected, the default view is USPC. Use the pulldown menu to select NBER or CPC instead.</p>

The “exact phrase” option (“ “) option finds the specific phrase in any of the fields being searched. The default option is “with all of the words.”</p>
