<h3>Methods &amp; Sources</h3>
<div class="col2">
<p>The PatentsView API provides access to a newly developed data source, which uses probabilistic methods to determine whether or not inventors with the same name are indeed the same person and generate disambiguated inventor identifies. Automatic disambiguation of inventor identifies is critical to exploring patterns and trends in US and international patenting activity. Both the visualization and query tools draw from this public, prototype API.</p>

<p>The PatentsView data warehouse is sourced from USPTO-provided text and XML data on published patent applications (2001-2014) and granted patents (1976-2014). These data are publicly available at <a href="http://patents.reedtech.com" target="_blank">patents.reedtech.com</a>. Data are <a href="https://github.com/CSSIP-AIR/PatentsProcessor/blob/master/FullDBLoadProcess.md" target="_blank">parsed and structured</a> into a relational database. From this database, assignee and lawyer disambiguations are performed and the patents are geocoded with a location-based disambiguation.</p>

<h4>Assignee Disambiguation</h4>
<p>The PatentsView data generation process does not fully disambiguate the names of assignees. A preliminary disambiguation of the records corrects for minor misspellings by applying the Jaro-Winkler2 string similarity algorithm to each pair of raw assignee records. In other words, records that are within a certain bound of similarity are considered the same and are linked together.</p>

<h4>Location Disambiguation</h4>
<p>City/state/country text as it appears in source files is algorithmically matched against a master geocode file from <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/open-source-data-and-api-for-ip-geolocation" target="_blank">MaxMind</a> open source files.</p>

<h4>Inventor Disambiguation</h4>
<p>When an inventor applies for a patent, the USPTO does not require that he or she record a unique identifier. As a result, searching for all the patents associated with a specific inventor can be difficult. This is particularly true if the inventor’s name is common or has multiple forms. The PatentsView tool relies on a <a href="http://cssip.org/docs/publications/inventor_disambiguator_v1.2.pdf" target="_blank">large scale-clustering algorithm</a> (adaptive K-means) to automatically associate patents with the same inventor, a technique known as disambiguation. The algorithm considers statistical correlations on patent attributes (published name, patent technology class, city, his/her co-inventor names, and assignee) to determine whether or not the inventor names belong to the same individual. Data are fed into the inventor disambiguation algorithm and clusters of inventor names that are determined to be the same entity are assigned a unique ID that is a combination of their first patent number and their inventor sequence in that patent.</p>

<p>Because the disambiguation of inventor identity is an ongoing effort, there are likely to be errors in this algorithm observable in the PatentsView query results. The team welcomes <a href="mailto:cssip@air.org">feedback</a> as we continue to improve on our disambiguation methodology.</p>

<p>The PatentsView team is hosting a technical workshop in 2015 in order to encourage the development of novel methods to increase inventor disambiguation in US patent data.</p>

<h4>Patent Classes and Technologies</h4>
<p>Patents are classified by three distinct schemes in the PatentsView database—US patent classification (USPC), cooperative patent classification (CPC) and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) technology area subcategories. All patent classes visualized in the tool represent the current patent class, unless otherwise noted.</p>
