<h3>What is a Patent Class?</h3>
<div class="col2">
<p>
Patents are classified by three distinct schemes in the PatentsView data visualization tool:</p>
<ul>
	<li>US patent classification (USPC)</li> 
	<li>The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) (Hall, Jaffe, Trajtenberg, 2001) technology categories</li> 
	<li>Cooperative patent classification (CPC)</li> 
</ul>
<p>All USPC, NBER, and CPC patent classes appearing in the visualization tool represent the current patent class, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<h3>How to Search for a Patent Class</h3>

For each patent, the USPC primary main class, the NBER primary subcategory, and all CPC subsections and classes are searchable. All classifications are current class.</p>
